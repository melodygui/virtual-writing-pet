# üêï Mocha's Walk ‚Äì Pixel Writing Pet Companion
Mocha's Walk is a fun, interactive writing companion app where every word you type helps your virtual pixel dog move closer to a goal!
As you write, Mocha walks along a path toward a tasty bone ‚Äî hitting progress milestones along the way, wagging its tail, and celebrating when you meet your daily word goal.
Perfect for writers, students, or anyone who wants a cute productivity boost.

---
## How It Works

1. Start typing in the writing area ‚Äî Mocha wakes up and begins walking.
2. Each word you write moves Mocha forward along the path toward the bone.
3. Reach milestones (25%, 50%, 75%) to see Mocha‚Äôs mood improve.
4. Hit 100% and celebrate with hearts, sparkles, and a glowing bone.

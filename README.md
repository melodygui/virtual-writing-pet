# 🐕 Mocha's Walk – Pixel Writing Pet Companion
**Live Demo:** [https://virtual-writing-pet.vercel.app/](https://virtual-writing-pet.vercel.app/) 

Mocha's Walk is a fun, interactive writing companion app where every word you type helps your virtual pixel dog move closer to a goal!
As you write, Mocha walks along a path toward a tasty bone — hitting progress milestones along the way, wagging its tail, and celebrating when you meet your daily word goal.
Perfect for writers, students, or anyone who wants a cute productivity boost.


## 🌟 Features

- **Live Word Tracking** – Counts your words as you type.
- **Customizable Daily Goal** – Set your own target word count.
- **Pixel Dog Animation** – Mocha walks, bobs, and celebrates as you make progress.
- **Level System** – Unlocks new moods at 25%, 50%, 75%, and 100% completion.
- **Fun Feedback** – Motivational messages based on your progress.

## How It Works

1. Start typing in the writing area — Mocha wakes up and begins walking.
2. Each word you write moves Mocha forward along the path toward the bone.
3. Reach milestones (25%, 50%, 75%) to see Mocha’s mood improve.
4. Hit 100% and celebrate with hearts, sparkles, and a glowing bone.
